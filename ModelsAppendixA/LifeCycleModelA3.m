%% Life-Cycle Model A3: Permanent (unit-root/random-walk) shocks
% Change the exogenous shock z to be a permanent shock
% We will choose a simple case where z has probability 0.5 of remaining the same value, 0.25 of decreasing, and 0.25 of increasing.
% Because the shocks are permanent you will typically want more grid points on z, we do this, increasing n_z.

% Note: If you have a brownian-motion (a random-walk/unit-root where the
% innovations are normally distributed), you can discretize this using the
% same 'life-cycle AR(1)' discretization commands used in  Life-Cycle Model A4

%% How does VFI Toolkit think about this?
%
% One decision variable: h, labour hours worked
% One endogenous state variable: a, assets (total household savings)
% One stochastic exogenous state variable: z, a permanent shock
% Age: j

%% Begin setting up to use VFI Toolkit to solve
% Lets model agents from age 20 to age 100, so 81 periods

Params.agejshifter=19; % Age 20 minus one. Makes keeping track of actual age easy in terms of model age
Params.J=100-Params.agejshifter; % =81, Number of period in life-cycle

% Grid sizes to use
n_d=51; % Endogenous labour choice (fraction of time worked)
n_a=201; % Endogenous asset holdings
n_z=51; % Exogenous labor productivity units shock

%% Grids
% The ^3 means that there are more points near 0 and near 10. We know from
% theory that the value function will be more 'curved' near zero assets,
% and putting more points near curvature (where the derivative changes the most) increases accuracy of results.
a_grid=10*(linspace(0,1,n_a).^3)'; % The ^3 means most points are near zero, which is where the derivative of the value fn changes most.

% depend, and there is one decision for each decision variable 'd' and each endogenous state variable 'a'

%% Now, we want to graph Life-Cycle Profiles

%% Initial distribution of agents at birth (j=1)
% Before we plot the life-cycle profiles we have to define how agents are
% at age j=1. We will give them all zero assets.
jequaloneDist=zeros(n_a,n_z,'gpuArray'); % Put no households anywhere on grid
jequaloneDist(1,floor((n_z+1)/2))=1; % All agents start with zero assets, and the median shock

%% We now compute the 'stationary distribution' of households
% Start with a mass of one at initial age, use the conditional survival
% probabilities sj to calculate the mass of those who survive to next
% period, repeat. Once done for all ages, normalize to one
Params.mewj=ones(1,Params.J); % Marginal distribution of households over age
for jj=2:length(Params.mewj)
    Params.mewj(jj)=Params.sj(jj-1)*Params.mewj(jj-1);

% Again, we will explain in a later model what the stationary distribution
% is, it is not important for our current goal of graphing the life-cycle profile

%% FnsToEvaluate are how we say what we want to graph the life-cycles of
% Like with return function, we have to include (h,aprime,a,z) as first
% inputs, then just any relevant parameters.
FnsToEvaluate.fractiontimeworked=@(h,aprime,a,z) h; % h is fraction of time worked
FnsToEvaluate.earnings=@(h,aprime,a,z,w,kappa_j) w*kappa_j*z*h; % w*kappa_j*z*h is the labor earnings (note: h will be zero when z is zero, so could just use w*kappa_j*h)
FnsToEvaluate.assets=@(h,aprime,a,z) a; % a is the current asset holdings

% notice that we have called these fractiontimeworked, earnings and assets

%% Calculate the life-cycle profiles
AgeConditionalStats=LifeCycleProfiles_FHorz_Case1(StationaryDist,Policy,FnsToEvaluate,Params,[],n_d,n_a,n_z,N_j,d_grid,a_grid,z_grid,simoptions);

% AgeConditionalStats.earnings.Mean
% There are things other than Mean, but in our current deterministic model
% in which all agents are born identical the rest are meaningless.
