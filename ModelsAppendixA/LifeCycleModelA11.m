%% Life-Cycle Model A11: Idiosyncratic shocks again, persistent and transitory
% Use two exogenous shocks: z1 and z2, persistent and transitory shocks to labor efficiency units, respectively
% Shows how you can model an i.i.d shock by pretending it is a markov shocks.
% This is not something you would ever want to do in practice (it is slower), and is just here to help you understand markov transition matrices better.

%% How does VFI Toolkit think about this?
%
% One decision variable: h, labour hours worked
% One endogenous state variable: a, assets (total household savings)
% Two stochastic exogenous state variables: z1 and z2, persistent and transitory shocks to labor efficiency units, respectively
% Age: j

%% Begin setting up to use VFI Toolkit to solve
% Lets model agents from age 20 to age 100, so 81 periods

Params.agejshifter=19; % Age 20 minus one. Makes keeping track of actual age easy in terms of model age
Params.J=100-Params.agejshifter; % =81, Number of period in life-cycle

% Grid sizes to use
n_d=51; % Endogenous labour choice (fraction of time worked)
n_a=201; % Endogenous asset holdings
n_z=[21,5]; % Exogenous labor productivity units shocks, persistent and transitiory

%% Now, we want to graph Life-Cycle Profiles

jequaloneDist(1,floor((n_z(1)+1)/2),floor((n_z(2)+1)/2))=1; % All agents start with zero assets, and the median value of each shock

%% We now compute the 'stationary distribution' of households
% Start with a mass of one at initial age, use the conditional survival
% probabilities sj to calculate the mass of those who survive to next
% period, repeat. Once done for all ages, normalize to one
Params.mewj=ones(1,Params.J); % Marginal distribution of households over age

% is, it is not important for our current goal of graphing the life-cycle profile

%% FnsToEvaluate are how we say what we want to graph the life-cycles of
% Like with return function, we have to include (h,aprime,a,z) as first
% inputs, then just any relevant parameters.
FnsToEvaluate.fractiontimeworked=@(h,aprime,a,z1,z2) h; % h is fraction of time worked
FnsToEvaluate.earnings=@(h,aprime,a,z1,z2,w,kappa_j) w*kappa_j*h*z1*z2; % w*kappa_j*h*z is the labor earnings (note: h will be zero when z is zero, so could just use w*kappa_j*h)
FnsToEvaluate.assets=@(h,aprime,a,z1,z2) a; % a is the current asset holdings

% notice that we have called these fractiontimeworked, earnings and assets

%% Calculate the life-cycle profiles
