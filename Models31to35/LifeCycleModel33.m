%% Life-Cycle Model 33: Portfolio-Choice with Warm-Glow of Bequests
% Warm-Glow of Bequests is subtle with Epstein-Zin preferences. We simply
% extend Life-Cycle Model 32 to include Warm-Glow of Bequests.

% To use warm-glow of bequests, you have to be using survival probabilities as a risk
vfoptions.survivalprobability='sj';

% Second, we set up a warm-glow of bequest function that takes (next period endogenous state)
% aprime as input (plus any parameters)
vfoptions.WarmGlowBequestsFn=@(aprime,wg,sigma,agej,J) LifeCycleModel33_WarmGlowBequestsFn(aprime,wg,sigma,agej,J);
% This is essentially putting aprime into the utility function, and then
% also multiplying the whole thing by wg, which is thus a parameter that
% controls the strength of the bequest motive
Params.wg=1;

%% How does VFI Toolkit think about this?
%
% Two decision variable: riskyshare and savings (total savings, and the share of savings invested in the risky asset)
% One endogenous state variable: a, assets
% One stochastic exogenous state variable: z, an AR(1) process (in logs), idiosyncratic shock to labor productivity units
% One between-period i.i.d. variable: u, the return to the risky asset
% Age: j

%% Begin setting up to use VFI Toolkit to solve
% Lets model agents from age 20 to age 100, so 81 periods

Params.agejshifter=19; % Age 20 minus one. Makes keeping track of actual age easy in terms of model age
Params.J=100-Params.agejshifter; % =81, Number of period in life-cycle

% Grid sizes to use
n_d=[51,201]; % Decisions: riskyshare, savings
n_a=201; % Endogenous asset holdings
n_z=21; % Exogenous labor productivity units shock
n_u=5; % Between period i.i.d. shock
N_j=Params.J; % Number of periods in finite horizon

vfoptions.riskyasset=1; % riskyasset aprime(d,u)
simoptions.riskyasset=1;

% Specify Epstein-Zin preferences
vfoptions.exoticpreferences='EpsteinZin';
vfoptions.EZpositiveutility=0; % Epstein-Zin preferences in utility-units have to be handled differently depending on whether the utility funciton is positive or negative valued (this is all done internally, you just need to use vfoptions to specify which)
vfoptions.EZriskaversion='phi'; % additional risk-aversion
% Params.phi is set below

%% To speed up the use of riskyasset we use 'refine_d', which requires us to set the decision variables in a specific order
vfoptions.refine_d=[0,1,1]; % tell the code how many d1, d2, and d3 there are
% Idea is to distinguish three categories of decision variable:
%  d1: decision is in the ReturnFn but not in aprimeFn
%  d2: decision is in the aprimeFn but not in ReturnFn
%  d3: decision is in both ReturnFn and in aprimeFn
% Note: ReturnFn must use inputs (d1,d3,..) 
%       aprimeFn must use inputs (d2,d3,..)
% n_d must be set up as n_d=[n_d1, n_d2, n_d3]
% d_grid must be set up as d_grid=[d1_grid; d2_grid; d3_grid];
% It is possible to solve models without any d1, as is the case here.
