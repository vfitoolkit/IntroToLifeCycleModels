%% Life-Cycle Model 35: Portfolio-Choice with Housing
% Same as life-cycle model 35, but without the Epstein-Zin preferences

% Now with housing which is modelled as a standard endogenous state that
% can take six values (the first value is zero which represents not owning
% a house).
% In terms of code, using 'riskyasset' alongside a standard asset means:
% The return function and functions to evaluate have first inputs (d,hprime,h,a,z,...) [no aprime like in Case1]
% Notice that we have hprime and h (for the standard asset), but only a for
% the risky asset (no aprime).
% We need to define aprime(d,u)

% We just treat survival probabilities as another discount factor
DiscountFactorParamNames={'beta','sj'};


%% How does VFI Toolkit think about this?
%
% Two decision variable: savings and riskyshare (total savings, and the share of savings invested in the risky asset)
% Two endogenous state variables: h and a (housing and assets)
% One stochastic exogenous state variable: z, an AR(1) process (in logs), idiosyncratic shock to labor productivity units
% One between-period i.i.d. variable: u, the return to the risky asset
% Age: j

%% Begin setting up to use VFI Toolkit to solve
% Lets model agents from age 20 to age 100, so 81 periods

Params.agejshifter=19; % Age 20 minus one. Makes keeping track of actual age easy in terms of model age
Params.J=100-Params.agejshifter; % =81, Number of period in life-cycle

% Grid sizes to use
n_d=[51,201]; % Decisions: riskyshare, savings
n_a=[5,201]; % Endogenous housing and asset holdings
n_z=7; % Exogenous labor productivity units shock
n_u=5; % Between period i.i.d. shock
N_j=Params.J; % Number of periods in finite horizon

vfoptions.riskyasset=1; % riskyasset aprime(d,u)
simoptions.riskyasset=1;
% When there is more than one endogenous state, the riskyasset is the last one

%% To speed up the use of riskyasset we use 'refine_d', which requires us to set the decision variables in a specific order
vfoptions.refine_d=[0,1,1]; % tell the code how many d1, d2, and d3 there are
% Idea is to distinguish three categories of decision variable:
%  d1: decision is in the ReturnFn but not in aprimeFn
%  d2: decision is in the aprimeFn but not in ReturnFn
%  d3: decision is in both ReturnFn and in aprimeFn
% Note: ReturnFn must use inputs (d1,d3,..) 
%       aprimeFn must use inputs (d2,d3,..)
% n_d must be set up as n_d=[n_d1, n_d2, n_d3]
% d_grid must be set up as d_grid=[d1_grid; d2_grid; d3_grid];
% It is possible to solve models without any d1, as is the case here.
