% Fella-Gallipoli-Pan discretization method for a 'life-cycle non-stationary AR(1) process'. 
% This is an extension of the Rouwenhorst method to 'age-dependent parameters'
% 
%  Exteneded-Rouwenhurst method to approximate life-cycle AR(1) process by a discrete Markov chain
%       z(j) = rho(j)*z(j-1)+ epsilon(j),   epsilion(j)~iid N(0,sigma(j))
%       with initial condition z(0) = 0 (equivalently z(1)=epsilon(1)) 
%
% Inputs:  
%   rho 	     - Jx1 vector of serial correlation coefficients
%   sigma        - Jx1 vector of standard deviations of innovations
%   znum         - Number of grid points (scalar, is the same for all ages)
%   J            - Number of 'ages' (finite number of periods)
% Optional inputs (fellagallipolipanoptions)
%   parallel:    - set equal to 2 to use GPU, 0 to use CPU
% Output: 
%   z_grid_J     - an znum-by-J matrix, each column stores the Markov state space for period j
%   pi_z_J       - znum-by-znum-by-J matrix of J (znum-by-znum) transition matrices. 
%                  Transition probabilities are arranged by row.
%                  P(:,:,j) is transition matrix from age j to j+1 (Modified from FGP where it is j-1 to j)
%   jequaloneDistz - znum-by-1 vector, the distribution of z in period 1
%   otheroutputs - optional output structure containing info for evaluating the distribution including,
%        otheroutputs.sigma_z     - the standard deviation of z at each age (used to determine grid)

% Two changes from FGP2019:
%    i) Allow z0 to be a normal distribution, rather than forcing z0=0;
%    using fellagallipolipanoptions.initialj0sigma_z
%    ii) Here P_J(:,:,j) is transition from j to j+1; in FGP2019 it was from j-1 to j.
