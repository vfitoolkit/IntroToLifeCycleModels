% Fella-Gallipoli-Pan discretization method for a 'life-cycle non-stationary AR(1) process'. 
% This is an extension of the Tauchen method to 'age-dependent parameters'
% 
%  Exteneded-Tauchen method to approximate life-cycle AR(1) process by a discrete Markov chain
%       z(j) = mew(j)+rho(j)*z(j-1)+ epsilon(j),   epsilion(j)~iid N(0,sigma(j))
%       with initial condition z(0) = 0 (equivalently z(1)=epsilon(1)) 
% 
% Inputs: 
%   mew          - Jx1 vector of 'drifts'
%   rho 	     - Jx1 vector of serial correlation coefficients
%   sigma        - Jx1 vector of standard deviations of innovations
%   znum         - Number of grid points (scalar, is the same for all ages)
%   J            - Number of 'ages' (finite number of periods)
% Optional inputs (fellagallipolipanoptions)
%   nSigmas           - the grid used will be +-nSigmas*(standard deviation of z)
%                        nSigmas is the hyperparamer of the Tauchen method
%   parallel:         - set equal to 2 to use GPU, 0 to use CPU
%        You can control the initial period with the following:
%        By default, assume z0=0
%   initialj0sigmaz:  - Set period 0 to be a N(z0, initialj0sigmaz^2) using initialj0sigmaz
%   initialj0mewz:    - Give period 0 a mean of z0=initialj0mew_z (as a point, or as mean of normal dist is you are also setting initialj0sigmaz
%        Or you set the period 1 (instead of period 0) using
%   initialj1mewz:    - Set period 1 to be mean of initialj1mew_z
%   initialj1sigmaz:  - Set period 1 to be a N(z0, initialj1sigmaz^2) using initialj1sigmaz
%        Note, for both period 0 and period 1, you can set one or both of
%        mean and standard deviation (the other is interpreted as zero
%        valued if not specified).
% Output: 
%   z_grid_J       - an znum-by-J matrix, each column stores the Markov state space for period j
%   pi_z_J         - znum-by-znum-by-J matrix of J (znum-by-znum) transition matrices. 
%                  Transition probabilities are arranged by row.
%                  pi_z_J(:,:,j) is transition matrix from age j to j+1 (Modified from FGP where it is j-1 to j)
%   jequaloneDistz - znum-by-1 vector, the distribution of z in period 1
%   otheroutputs - optional output structure containing info for evaluating the distribution including,
%        otheroutputs.sigma_z     - the standard deviation of z at each age (used to determine grid)
