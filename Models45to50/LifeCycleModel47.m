%% Life-Cycle Model 47: GMM Estimation of a Life-Cycle Model
% Model is same as we had in Life-Cycle Model 45.
% Main thing we do here is use data to get data moments (the target
% moments), the covariance matrix of the data moments (needed for
% calculating the covariance matrix of the estimated parameter vector), and
% also look at how data can be used for the weighting matrix, as well as
% comparing some different options in terms of the weighting matrix.

% We will use a profile for age-conditional mean earnings as our target.
% We estimate the parameter kappa_j (the determinitistic component of earnings, which is age-dependent)
% Note, this is not simple because there is endogenous labor.
paramerizeKappaj=1; % Can be set to 0 or 1
% =1: We parameterize kappa_j (as a fifth order polynomial) and then estimate 
%     the co-efficients of the parametrization (six parameters of a third-order 
%     polynomial).
% =0: we estimate kappa_j as 45 different numbers (the age-conditional values, for each working age)
% Note that in practice it is standard to parametrize age-dependent
% variables, like kappa_j, as polynomials. We set this up as an option so you can
% see how the toolkit can handle both approaches.

% We use the publically available PSID data to estimate the age-conditional
% mean of earnings (you will need to download the data before you run this
% command, as explained a few lines below). When we do the data work we
% show how to do time vs cohort fixed effects (and discuss the issue
% briefly). 
% We then use the same data so show how to estimate the covariance matrix
% of the data moments. (What the theory calls Omega.)

% We then perform the estimation three times, using different weighting matrices.
% As long as the weighting matrix is positive semi-definite, the GMM
% estimator will be consistent and asymptotically normal.
% First we use W=I, the identity matrix. This is just demonstrated as an easy choice.
% Second we use W has on the diagonal the inverse of the diagonal elements of Omega (the
%    covariance matrix of the data moments), with zeros on the off-diagonal elements
% Third we use W equals the inverse of the Omega. This is efficient GMM
%
% The first W=I has the problem of being 'scale dependent', if we measure
% the earnings targets in dollars of thousands of dollars we will get
% different estimated parameter vectors.
% The second W is an example of a weighting matrix that avoids scale
% dependence. And is a popular choice in the literature.
% The third is called 'efficient' because it gives the smallest values for
% the covariance matrix of the estimated parameter vector. But it can
% suffer from being biased in small samples.

% We will start with the data work.

%% Now, let's think about options for the weighting matrix
% We have used W=I, the identity matrix. This works, but is a very naive choice.

% Using W=Omega^(-1) gives us "efficient GMM"
% Efficient GMM is explained in the Appendix of the Intro to Life-Cycle Models about GMM estimation
% https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vfitoolkit/IntroToLifeCycleModels/main/Documentation/LifeCycleModels.pdf

%% Efficient GMM

%% Another option is W=diag(Omega)^(-1) [zeros on the off-diagonals]

% The efficient GMM can be biased in small samples (because of correlation
% between our estimate of Omega, and our estimates of M^d, the data moments).

% The identity matrix is scale-dependent (if we change our moments from
% being measured in thousands of dollars to being measured in dollars, then
% the estimates change).

% So another option is to use
WeightingMatrix=diag(diag(CovarMatrixDataMoments_CFE.^(-1)));
% This eliminates the issue of scale-dependence (especially important if,
% e.g., one moment is measured in dollars and another moment is measured in
% hours). It will be less efficient than W=Omega^(-1), but is more likely
% to be robust in small samples (less likely to suffer from bias).

%% GMM Theory tells us that any positive semi-definite weighting matrix W will converge to the true estimated parameters.
% So the decision of which weighting matrix to choose is about balancing robustness against efficiency. 
% As can be seen above, trying, e.g., both W=Omega^(-1) and W=diag(Omega)^(-1) is easy enough.

% Notice that all three give similar, but still importantly different, parameter estimates
EstimParams1 % W=I
EstimParams2 % Efficient GMM, W=Omega^(-1)
EstimParams3 % W=diag(Omega)^(-1)
% And we can also compare the confidence intervals, the efficent estimator
% has generally smaller confidence intervals (which is what efficient is about)
