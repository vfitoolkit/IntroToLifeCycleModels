%% Life-Cycle Model 28: Two decision variables (dual-earner household)
% Model of a household with two people. They share savings but can choose
% how much each of the two works. Each person has a persistent AR(1) and a
% transitory iid component to their labor efficiency units. The shocks to
% each person are correlated.
%
% Model shows how to do two decision variables.
% Model also usees 'joint grids' for the exogenous variables (see Life-Cycle Model A9).
%
% Use Farmer-Toda which produces a 'joint grid', as opposed to a cross-product (kronecker) grid.
% Extends Life-Cycle Model 11, adding the second earner to the household.
%
% Notice that while there are, e.g., two deterministic labor productivity
% earnings as a function of age (one for each earner), we do not use
% permament types as both are relevant to the one household.
%
% To keep the emphasis on the two decision variables (and the shock
% processes) we will keep everything else as little changed as possible, so
% we just add an extra term to the utility function for h2 that is
% identical to that for h1 (using the same parameters).
%
% Note: Typically in practice for this kind of model people want to capture
% that one spouse might choose not to work. This will almost never happen in the
% current setup but is easy to get just adding a fixed cost of working to
% the spouse (include a -fc*(h2>0) term in the budget constraint but
% modifying the return function, where fc is the fixed cost; you could model it 
% so the fixed cost is only incurred if both work).
%
% This example is a larger model than most, so to still be able to solve it
% on a gpu with 8gb gpu-memory we use vfoptions.lowmemory=1 (and
% vfoptions.paroverz=1) so that the value function is solved looping over
% the e variables but parallel over the z variables.

%% How does VFI Toolkit think about this?
%
% Two decision variable: h1 and h2, labour hours worked by each spouse
% One endogenous state variable: a, assets (total household savings)
% Four stochastic exogenous state variables: 
%     z1 and z2, both are AR(1) shocks to labor efficiency units
%     e1 and e2, both are iid shocks to labor efficiency units
% Age: j

%% Grids
% The ^3 means that there are more points near 0 and near 10. We know from

% and putting more points near curvature (where the derivative changes the most) increases accuracy of results.
a_grid=10*(linspace(0,1,n_a).^3)'; % The ^3 means most points are near zero, which is where the derivative of the value fn changes most.

% First, the AR(1) process on z1 and z2 with correlated innovations.
% Notice that this is just a VAR(1) process on z1 and z2 (with zeros on the off-diagonals of the auto-correlation matrix)
% We use the Farmer-Toda method to discretize the VAR(1)
% Note that for VAR(1), the Farmer-Toda method produces a 'joint grid'

%% We now compute the 'stationary distribution' of households
% Start with a mass of one at initial age, use the conditional survival
% probabilities sj to calculate the mass of those who survive to next
% period, repeat. Once done for all ages, normalize to one
Params.mewj=ones(1,Params.J); % Marginal distribution of households over age
